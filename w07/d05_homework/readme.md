Write a self-reflection about your experiences learning JavaScript. You may publish

writing on the milk and cookies repo.

  So I realize this is more than a little late, but maybe it will give me a little better perspective.
First I was excited to learn Javascript. I knew it would help make pages more interactive and any language that helped make CookieClicker is fine with me. But as we began learning the ins and outs of the language, I found myself lost and frustrated. Espcially during the object oriented/class inheritence section. I was missing the simplicity and structure of ruby. 

However as we started making larger projects it became clear how powerful and helpful JS could be. Instead of navigating to a new path after every CRUD request, we could just render the results in real time on the same page. JS allows us(through ajax) to use api(s) in a (sometimes) easy to use JSON format. And it can handle all kinds of User generated events that add to the overall experience of an app. I've also slowly gained a little more confidence in JS/JQuery/OO JS. At least enough to see a very faint light at the end of this tunnel. Which is all I need to keep going forward.
